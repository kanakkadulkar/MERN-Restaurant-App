Read good reviews about this place so went and checked for myself and I wasn't disappointed. We ordered green chicken tandoori and mutton lajawab. Both meat pieces were soft, tender and cooked very well. It was simply Lip smackingly delicious. This cozy little place is true to its name. Apratim indeed! Will definitely go there again."
