So I tried butter garlic prawns ü¶ê and Goan Chicken üêî curry. Both were hard, fantastic, mouth melting and delicious üòã. They have good ambience and positive vibes about good food üç≤. F&B staff is so polite and cooperative. Pocket friendly place for foodie. I'll visit again ü•∞."

        "description": "This place has been around for a while now but never really entered cuz it looks like a small Cafe but it serves everything from soups to North Indian dishes to thalis. Read good reviews about this place so went and checked for myself and I wasn't disappointed. We ordered green chicken tandoori and mutton lajawab. Both meat pieces were soft, tender and cooked very well. It was simply Lip smackingly delicious. This cozy little place is true to its name. Apratim indeed! Will definitely go there again."
